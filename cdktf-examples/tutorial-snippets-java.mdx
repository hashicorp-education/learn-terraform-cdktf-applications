## Initialize your CDKTF application

```shell
cdktf init --template=java \
           --project-name=learn-terraform-cdktf-applications \
           --project-description="Learn how to develop CDKTF applications" \
           --providers="kubernetes@~>2.14" \
           --local
```

```shell
Note: By supplying '--local' option you have chosen local storage mode for storing the state of your stack.
This means that your Terraform state file will be stored locally on disk in a file 'terraform.<STACK NAME>.tfstate' in the root of your project.
? Do you want to send crash reports to the CDKTF team? See

Use Providers:

  You can add prebuilt providers (if available) or locally generated ones using the add command:

  cdktf provider add "aws@~>3.0" null kreuzwerker/docker

  All prebuilt providers are available on Maven Central: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.hashicorp
  You can also add these providers directly to your pom.xml file.

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more: https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers

========================================================================================================
Checking whether pre-built provider exists for the following constraints:
  provider: kubernetes
  version : ~>2.14
  language: java
  cdktf   : 0.15.1

Found pre-built provider.
Adding com.hashicorp.cdktf-provider-kubernetes @ 5.0.1 to pom.xml
Package installed.
```

```diff
               .spec(DeploymentSpec.builder()
-                        .replicas("1")
+                        .replicas("4")
                         .selector(DeploymentSpecSelector.builder()
